# Information-Retrieval

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruptions in the global economy, and many countries are still struggling to recover. We created an information retrieval system to analyse market sentiments on whether there is a recession going on in 2023, and hoped to gain valuable public insights in a systematic way. The system enables user to enter specific keywords and generate a vast collection of Reddit posts and comments along with their respective classifications. We crawled a text corpus from Reddit, indexed using Solr, built a UI to query over the corpus, performed sentiment analysis over it, and enhanced our sentiment analysis using Ensemble Classifier, Name Entity Recognition, and GoEmotion. Our system enable the user to gain helpful insights and conduct further analysis on selected features, which could ultimately impact the classification of the Reddit posts and comments.
